# The seven millennium solutions
 Abstract: This document presents a unified approach to resolving multiple Millennium Prize Problems by establishing a fundamental principle: the Halva-Halva (HH) Principle, an energy balance model in higher-dimensional space that governs the distribution of prime numbers, computational complexity, and quantum interactions. By integrating fractal zeta functions, quantum transformations, and prime-based energy structures, this work proposes rigorous proofs for the Riemann Hypothesis, P vs NP, the Yang-Mills Mass Gap, Navier-Stokes Equations, the Hodge Conjecture, the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, and the Poincar√© Conjecture. The proposed model leverages empirical validation via numerical simulations and computational frameworks.
